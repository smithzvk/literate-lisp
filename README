Literate-Lisp: A very simple literate programming system for Common Lisp.

The goals of this project are to create a literate programming system where the
documentation lies in the comments of the program, making it LOADable,
COMPILEable, etc.  The syntax is loosely based on my understanding of noweb
syntax, which is very weak at best.

See the file literate-lisp.lisp for further documentation.
